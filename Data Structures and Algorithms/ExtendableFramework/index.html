        <h2>Tic Tac Toe Rules:</h2>
        <ul>- Tic Tac Toe is made by creating a 3x3 grid.</ul>
        <ul>- Players take turns placing one marker at a time (an X or an O).</ul>
        <ul>- To win, a line of three of your tile piece must be made (e.g. A vertical line, a horizontal line, or a diagonal line all of Xs).</ul>
        <ul>- A game can be considered a draw if no matching lines are made and all 9 spaces are filled.</ul>
