BESPOKE HOMEWARES ECOMMERCE STORE WEB APPLICATION

Bespoke Homewares is an ecommerce store which sells homewares that are
neatly organised into categories by rooms. The goal is to take away the
stress of decorating from the consumer and allow them to see all items
freely on a minimalistic site.

In this program the user is first taken to the homepage. From here they
can utilise the navigation bar to explore the website or view the weekly
sale. The website is populated by a database where all categories and
items are stored.
