The requirement of this assignment was to create a general framework that could be extended to
different types of games that utilised a grid (e.g. Tic Tac Toe, Reversi, etc.).
To demonstrate the functionallity of the framework, Tic Tac Toe has been implemented.

Features that have been implemented include:
- Human vs. Human (2 players) game mode
- Human vs Computer (1 player) game mode
- Computer easy difficulty (using a random number generator)
- A primitive help system
- Save and load a game (currently only available for two human players)
- Checking for move validity
- A scoring system

To be implemented in the future:
- Alpha-Beta Computer player difficulty
- undo/redo moves.
